# Hi there, I'm Kiruthika Ramadoss 👋

**Welcome to my GitHub profile!**

I’m a data and machine learning enthusiast currently pursuing my MS in Data Analytics & Information Systems at Texas State University (Current GPA: 4.0). I'm passionate about turning data into meaningful insights and building scalable, real-world solutions. With a strong foundation in Python, SQL, and Power BI, I enjoy applying analytics, automation, and machine learning to solve complex problems and drive decision-making.

## 🚀 Projects I've Worked On:


###  Sentiment Analysis of Twitter (X) Data  

🔗 [View GitHub Repository](https://github.com/KiruthikaRamadoss/Twitter-X-Sentiment-Analysis)

A machine learning and text mining project that classifies tweet sentiments (positive, neutral, negative) using TF-IDF and supervised learning models.

**Key Contributions:**

- Preprocessed and vectorized ~45,000 tweets using TF-IDF.
- Built and compared Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM classifiers.
- Created interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize sentiment trends by age and time of tweet.
- Explored public sentiment patterns to support marketing and brand analysis.

Technologies Used: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, TF-IDF, Power BI, Jupyter Notebook


###  Real-Time Network Anomaly Detection  

🔗 [View GitHub Repository](https://github.com/KiruthikaRamadoss/Real-Time-Network-Anomaly-Detection)

An end-to-end ML pipeline to detect anomalies in synthetic network traffic, simulating cybersecurity threat identification.

**Key Contributions:**

- Developed an anomaly detection model using Isolation Forest and Random Forest with SMOTE to address class imbalance.
- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to enhance model performance and reduce dimensionality.
- Achieved 83% recall and 63% accuracy in detecting anomalous traffic.
- Presented at TXST 1st Data and AI Day – Student Poster Showcase (2025).

Technologies Used: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, SMOTE, PCA, Jupyter Notebook


### Diabetes Prediction Using Health Indicators  

🔗 [View GitHub Repository](https://github.com/KiruthikaRamadoss/Diabetes-Prediction-ML)
